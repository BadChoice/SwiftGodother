# SwiftGodother
A multiplatform swiftgodot game example

# Inspiration
This project works as a base port of a SpriteKit game to godot.
The game is [Terminal Madness - Awakening](https://codepassion.io/tma) an adventure game of a young hacker (The Curse Of Monkey island meets Deponia)

# Installation

This uses the swiftgodot repo to create a GD extension
The idea of this game is that is fully implemented with swift, and using godot as the engine



路 [Download GODOT](https://godotengine.org/download)

路 Open the folder `TMRSwift` with XCode so it downloads the dependencies (or run the command to do so which I don't know at the moment)

路Try to run the project from XCode so it asks you to trust the libraries, trust them.

路 Then, to build it and run on mac just run

`./buildAndRun` from the terminal

> The first time, it might appear black, you need to open the `godot/project.godot` file in godot once so it reimports the assets
