"Maybe. I need to fuse two cables together, see. Unfortunately, my lighter died on me." = "";

"The only gold thing around is that bowling ball, but you need a ridiculous amount of tickets to get it" = "";
"Ohh, I see that it's not there anymore!" = "";

"Ah, I see! This pirate talk – it's just a test, right?" = "";
"Okay, let's see." = "";
"Uh – the strength is gold." = "";
"Whoever yer searching for, ye got the wrong sailor in front of ye, lad. I'm just an Old Salt who wants to quietly enjoy his rum in this harbor dive before setting sail again." = "";
"Ah. sorry my bad" = "";
"So - will ye buy me a grog or what?" = "";
"Sorry, no can do. I need to find the Supreme Hacker." = "";
"Yarr. Whatever floats your boat, lad." = "";
"You don't happen to know where I can find the real Supreme Hacker, do you?" = "";
"Nay. Can't claim that I do. Yer have to keep yer ears to the deck and yer eyes peeled." = "";
"Okay dokey. Uh, I mean: yohoho. Or whatever." = "";
"Say, what happened to your eye?" = "";
"Arr. What eye, matey?" = "";
"I thought the eye patch..." = "";
"Avast ye! It's called 'style'. Savvy?" = "";
"Occasionally." = "";
"Word is, there aren't any lighters allowed in this joint. That right?" = "";
"Yarr! They were outlawed a while ago. The young scallywags hereabouts found out that ye could start the arcade machine with a lighter spark and play fer free." = "";
"Kids these days, amirite? Wonder how they found that out..." = "";
"T'was I who showed them how to hornswaggle the darn thingies." = "";
"I did not see that coming." = "";
"That's why I be still sitting here, harhar!" = "";
"About that trick..." = "";
"Hurr?" = "";
"Can you teach me how to do it?" = "";
"Not so fast, laddie! First ye must tell me: what do ye want to meet this hacker character so badly for?" = "";
"Um, to become an elite hacker. Isn't that obvious?" = "";
"Yarr. But what do ye intend to do with all them hacker skills ye wish to learn?" = "";
"Okay," = "";
"I'll tell you. I want to..." = "";
"...get rich and famous!" = "";
"...create some beautiful chaos!" = "";
"...make the world a safer place!" = "";
"... hack my way to wealth and fame! What else?" = "";
"Arrh, but money'n fame be not everything, mate!" = "";
"Take me f'r instance: I used to be a famous underwear model. And what good did it do me?" = "";
"..." = "";
"You serious?" = "";
"Course not, ye scabby sea bass!" = "";
"Um, yeah, me neither." = "";
"See, the real reason is I want to..." = "";
"... create some sweet, sweet chaos! Throw some sand in the gears of the high and mighty, dig it?" = "";
"expose some corrupt politicians, bring some mega corporations to their knees." = "";
"You know." = "";
"That kinda stuff" = "";
"Arrh! Ye disappoint me, lad!" = "";
"Peel yer peepers" = "";
"there be enough madness'n mayhem in the world already!" = "";
"If that be yer real reason, ye won't get one more word from me about anything!" = "";
"Oops." = "";
"C'mon man, you know I was just joking, right?" = "";
"Right??" = "";
"Were ye now?" = "";
"Of course! There's only one reason I wanna become an elite hacker. And that's to..." = "";
"...make the world a safer place." = "";
"... protect the common people from all the BAD hackers out there. You know" = "";
"the scammers and phishers and grifters." = "";
"You know: all those bastards who take something awesome like the internet and use it to suck the money from other people's pockets." = "";
"If I'm an elite hacker, I'll give them a taste of their own medicine." = "";
"Um, metaphorically speaking." = "";
"Hrrr." = "";
"That so?" = "";
"Swear on my goldfish's grave!" = "";
"Arrh, laddie, then mayhaps there be some hope left for the youth of this world!" = "";
"So... you'll teach me the trick?" = "";
"Aye, I will teach it to ye!" = "";
"But ye must swear on Davy Jones' locker never to tell anyone. Ye hear?" = "";
"I swear" = "";
"On Davy Jones's locker and any other furniture involved!" = "";
"So listen up, matey. I'm only gonna tell yer once!" = "";
"*whisper* *whisper*" = "";
"Ahaa" = "";
"Wow, that's brilliant!" = "";
"Ain't it so?" = "";
"Now clear the deck, bucko, and heave ho!" = "";
"Aye, aye, cap'n!" = "";
"Do you happen to have a used coffee cup?" = "";
"I don't drink coffee, it's too weak" = "";
"Nah, I think I slashed that thing enough already." = "";
"I can't do anything while he's looking!" = "";
"I think I need something else" = "";
"There are no more tickets in there" = "";
"I've got everything I could from it." = "";
"Yeah, as I thought - it's a punching bag filled with sand." = "";
"The strength is gold!" = "";
"Hmm, I think something's still missing..." = "";
"I've built an amazing glass cutter!" = "";
"I think I need a coin or something to play it..." = "";
"Oops, it fell down. Let's try again!" = "";
"Musk it! Looks like the machine's not accepting THIS coin..." = "";
"I need to find something else" = "";
"Not now" = "";
"I'd like to have the golden bowling ball, please!" = "";
"You'll need a ridiculous amount of tickets for that. I don't think you will ever get them." = "";
"Sorry to disappoint you, but as it turns out, I DO HAVE THEM!" = "";
"WHAT?!" = "";
"But that's impossible! How did you get them all?" = "";
"It wasn't easy, it took years and years of hard work" = "";
"Okay, I must admit, you surprised me there, kid." = "";
"Have fun!" = "";
"Thank you, intend to!" = "";
"I'm sorry, but the rabbit's for marketing purposes only." = "";
"How can I earn those tickets?" = "";
"That's easy, just spend money on the machines" = "";
"And you will get tickets worth a quarter of the money you use." = "";
"Man, I'm in the wrong business!" = "";
"How exactly would I mix those?" = "";
"Nothing happened" = "";
"Empty" = "";
"Nah, I don't want the trap door to be closed again!" = "";
"It worked!" = "";
"Supreme Hacker, here I come!" = "";
"Welcome, Crypto. It seems you finally found me." = "";
"Charles effing Babbage! Could it be? Is it really HIM???" = "";
"How's my hair?" = "";
"Any crumbs in my beard?" = "";
"Damn, I hope my deodorant holds up!!" = "";
"*clears throat*" = "";
"Um..." = "";
"Hi there." = "";
"Greetings. I've been expecting you" = "";
"You were? But HOW?!" = "";
"I sent you an invitation." = "";
"Oh yeah, right. Sorry, totally star-struck here. I'm your bigest fan, y'know?" = "";
"Indeed I know. And that's why I invited you in the first place." = "";
"You show great promise, Crypto. That you found me proves you think creatively, outside the box." = "";
"That you're not afraid. Or willing to back down." = "";
"All attributes that will proof useful in your near future." = "";
"So...by finding you, I'm part of the team, right? An elite hacker, best of the best. Right?" = "";
"Right?" = "";
"No." = "";
"Bummer." = "";
"At least not yet. There is much left for you to learn. But with the right guidance" = "";
"I'm eager to start, what should I do next?" = "";
"Can't wait, let's start!" = "";
"I hope there are no more trials..." = "";
"I'm so excited! Get to it!" = "";
"Hell, yes! We can start anytime! I'm totally game!" = "";
"Um ... Sir." = "";
"I've no doubt. You're almost ready. But to become an elite hacker, you must enter the next level of the Elite Hacker Program" = "";
"Holy $%!§, yes, man, just show me the way!" = "";
"Of course, you won't find it in the analogue world." = "";
"Meaning...?" = "";
"The Elite Hacker Program can only be completed in..." = "";
"THE CYBERSPHERE!!" = "";
"Gasp!" = "";
"The CyberSphere!" = "";
"But I thought it was just a legend?" = "";
"That's what we want people to believe. But it's very real." = "";
"A digital universe, a cosmos of pure possibilities and imagination." = "";
"A new, better world." = "";
"Access is limited to only a chosen few. If you're willing to face the next level of our training, you will have to transfer you consciousness into the virtual realm of the CyberSphere." = "";
"Wait a sec" = "";
"My consciousness? And what about my body?" = "";
"You see these capsules around you?" = "";
"Yeah, but I thought those were just for effect." = "";
"Wait..." = "";
"Those are REAL people inside, not just some spooky mannequins?" = "";
"Indeed." = "";
"Oh man, how long have they been in there?" = "";
"Some of them for months." = "";
"Holy Turing! Months?!" = "";
"For others ... it's been even longer." = "";
"And perhaps it will be forever." = "";
"*gulp*" = "";
"To fulfil your dream, you only have one choice:" = "";
"Leave this mortal coil behind and enter the Cybersphere." = "";
"Or turn back now, and bury your hopes forever." = "";
"Are you afraid?" = "";
"Totally..." = "";
"Um, NOT, I mean!" = "";
"As I expected. I have high hopes for you, Crypto." = "";
"Don't disappoint me." = "";
"Count on me! How do I get in?" = "";
"I'm not really sure..." = "";
"I'll pass... that's too much for me" = "";
"I just remembered I had something to do, I'll be back!" = "";
"I'm in" = "";
"Good..." = "";
"There is just one problem..." = "";
"I have a bad feeling about this" = "";
"I ran out of CyberSphere pills, and they are required to transfer your conscience" = "";
"No problem, I can go and buy them" = "";
"Unfortunately, they are not for sale. Luckily though, I have the recipe for making them" = "";
"You just need..." = "";
"rabbit fur" = "";
"crushed ice" = "";
"lubricant" = "";
"Put them all in this bag, and mix them well" = "";
"Here is the ingredients list, too, so you won't forget" = "";
"Come back when you have them all and I will create the pill for you" = "";
"Then you will start your training inside the CyberSphere" = "";
"Are you sure you want me to do it?" = "";
"Hello again!" = "";
"Can you tell me again about the CyberSphere?" = "";
"Do you know where can I find some rabbit fur?" = "";
"Do you know where can I find some crushed ice?" = "";
"Do you know where can I find some lubricant?" = "";
"That's all" = "";
"I don't think it needs to be alive." = "";
"That might help!" = "";
"You might want to take a closer look at the bar." = "";
"This one should be easy" = "";
"That's really helpful" = "";
"I have them all!" = "";
"Okay, let's see...." = "";
"The ingredients are not mixed at all!" = "";
"I can't make the pill in this state..." = "";
"Okay..." = "";
"I have them all MIXED!" = "";
"That's it, I can make some new pills with it - just gimme a sec!" = "";
"Here it is" = "";
"Wow, this is it. The pill to enter the CyberSphere. I can't believe it's finally in my hands." = "";
"Yes, Crypto. This pill will grant you access to the most advanced virtual world in existence" = "";
"But be warned, it is not without its dangers. Are you sure you are ready to take this step?" = "";
"Of course I am!" = "";
"Absolutely!" = "";
"I've never, ever been this ready" = "";
"Not at all" = "";
"Come back when you are" = "";
"Nevermind, let's go for it!" = "";
"Good. Remember, the CyberSphere is a place of endless possibilities and unimaginable power. But with great power comes great responsibility" = "";
"Use it wisely, and never forget the code of the hacker: Do no harm, and protect the innocent" = "";
"I won't let you down" = "";
"May the code guide you, Crypto" = "";
"To create the CyberSphere pill I need..." = "";
"This will do it!" = "";
"I think even old Eagle Ears here will notice that this is not a WHITE rabbit." = "";
"I think it's white enough" = "";
"Why would I put it here?" = "";
"A white rabbit!" = "";
"It says..." = "";
"Be ECO! be SMART! be HAPPY!" = "";

"The Elite Hackers Program. I will a-a-act as your instructor." = "";
"My very own android Yoda! Sweet!" = "";
"If you wish to call it that." = "";
"Man, gotta say – this is amazing. All this feels absolutely authentic! This big white, featureless room could be a REAL big white featureless room in the real world!" = "";
"All those details!" = "";

"Just one is enough" = "";
"Alexa, I mean... TDD! Can you save this file I'm sending you?" = "";
"NEGATIVE! That could damage my internal components!" = "";
"Why would a robot need tracing paper?" = "";

"It has the barcode on it already." = "";
"Nah, I prefer to draw something meaningful, instead of just some doodles" = "";

"Welcome back, you nutcase." = "";
"Say, can you give me a little demonstration of the spaceship's sound system?" = "";
"I've got a music file I'd like to play." = "";
"I'd love to. But the system's still missing the wireless receiver." = "";

"And there is this loose card down here." = "";
"Hey kid, you got a collectible card lying around here!" = "";
"Yeah, I know, I got, like, a bunch of them. You can keep it!" = "";

"C'mon, hot steam... melt the label glue!" = "";
"Good old steam! Now I'm the proud owner of a barcode label sticker!" = "";

"Awesome! And just in the nick of time." = "";
"Thanks Billie! Gotta go witness rock history!" = "";
"Okay, Mr Crypto, you're up next!" = "";
"You know what, Billie? I changed my mind. Turns out I got an ink allergy." = "";
"Plus: Pink Lizard really..." = "";
"How should I put it delicately?" = "";
"Sucks monkey balls. So..." = "";
"Maybe another time!" = "";
"Ohh, that's too bad. But if you ever want a tattoo, you know where to find me!" = "";

"I should wait till I have the whole costume ready" = "";
"Thank you Nestor, those will come in handy" = "";
"I don't want plain sand" = "";
"I don't think I'll need any more." = "";
"I think I can use it as modelling clay, too!" = "";
"I need some kind of reference" = "";
"It's perfect as it is!" = "";
"I'd better make something specific." = "";
"They're absolutely identical!" = "";
"Perfect copy" = "";

"Look what I made for you! Ta-daa! A life-sized Mali replica!" = "";
"I LOVE it!" = "";
"A black light gun!" = "";
"I'm don't need the ink anymore, since it's empty now." = "";
"Want some?" = "";
"Keep it away from me!" = "";
"You said you needed some methane as fuel, right?" = "";
"But not in this state!" = "";
"Just give it a try, I can make more" = "";
"I'm not touching that thing. Go put it into the fuel slot yourself." = "";
"Here you go!" = "";
"I can't believe it really works!" = "";
"I should give it some shape before baking it" = "";
"Baked!" = "";
"I'm sure this'll help me complete a quest... even if I don't know which. Or why. Or where." = "";
"TDD, my man, I'm gonna put you into this box. I wanna try something." = "";
"This is not the right place to do it" = "";
"Okay, we'll try that later, TDD." = "";
"Oh, hello there! Welcome to Billie's Tattoo saloon!" = "";
"The place where all your dreams come true. Um, provided they're dreams of tattoos." = "";
"I'm Billie, by the way. Nice to meet you!" = "";
"Come on in! Billie is a true artist!" = "";
"Uh, hi, Billie. Hi, stranger." = "";
"Oh, where are my manners? I'm Nestor." = "";
"You want some ink, too? Sorry, I'm afraid you'll have to wait til I'm finished with Nestor." = "";
"See that? A new masterpiece in the making. Classic Billie!" = "";
"Um, you mean those straight lines on your arm? Yeah, they look real...creative." = "";
"Thank you, that's so darling of you!" = "";
"Those aren't just any old lines. They're a barcode of my Pink Lizard's social network account." = "";
"Wow, that's an, uh, interesting choice." = "";
"As soon as it's finished, I'll be able to enter the Pink Lizard rock show!" = "";
"Speaking of which: can you tell me about this Pink Lizard guy? I've seen posters all around town." = "";
"Are you seriously telling me you never heard of Pink Lizard – the rock star/influencer/all around awesome guy?" = "";
"Seriously." = "";
"So the CyberSphere has influencers too? Hooray..." = "";
"Excuse me, the cyber-what?" = "";
"Anyway, he's performing a live rock show today, and I can't miss it!" = "";
"But only TRUE fans can get in." = "";
"Define 'true'?" = "";
"You have to prove your fandom by getting a tattoo like this." = "";
"Doesn't that make you feel more ike, I dunno, branded cattle?" = "";
"Yeah..." = "";
"He's the best!" = "";
"Teehee." = "";
"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS NOISE?" = "";
"I've never listened to anything this TERRIBLE before!" = "";
"My ears are actually BLEEDING!" = "";
"Itʼs like they put a bunch of cats in heat into a tin barrel – only not as melodic!" = "";
"All this work just to stumble into this hellish soundscape!" = "";
"At least the place is highly soundproofed, so you can't hear anything from the outside." = "";
"I guess that's about the only good thing you can say about this show..." = "";
"TDD, please tell me you can switch on some kind of noise filter for me!" = "";
"Affirmative. As a matter of fact, I need one for my own audio receptors as well." = "";
"Ahhh! That's better!" = "";
"Showtime!" = "";
"Luckily, I've got the noise filter on this time!" = "";
"Oh no, it's all coming back to me now: the music, the awful music!" = "";
"Noise filter, don't fail me now" = "";
"Filter on!" = "";
"Oh, it's you again. How can I humili-- uh, I mean, help you?" = "";
"I've got a voucher here for a free burger!" = "";
"Let's see..." = "";
"Hm. This one's from a couple years ago..." = "";
"But I guess it's still valid." = "";
"BURGER TIME!!!" = "";
"And... DONE. A delicious veggie burger, ready to delight your taste buds!" = "";
"Wait a sec. 'VEGGIE?'" = "";
"Yep, that's what the voucher says on the flip side. Didn't you read the fine print?" = "";
"*Sigh* Now that you mention it, I didn't." = "";
"But... a gift horse's mouth and whatnot." = "";
"Don't forget the ketchup and garlic sauce!" = "";
"I don't think they will make it edible, but hope springs eternal." = "";
"Um, I really can't let you do that, sorry!" = "";
"Fair enough." = "";
"Normally, I'm more of a creative guy, but I think I need to be hyper precise here" = "";
"Guess what I got!" = "";
"Besides an unkempt beard?" = "";
"I got into the Pink Lizard show." = "";
"You did? But – HOW?? Last time, you didn't even know who he was!" = "";
"Besides... you got no tattoo!" = "";
"What is your secret? WHAT?? You need to tell me!!!" = "";
"My lips are sealed." = "";
"Billie, come on, man, finish the damn thing already! I need to go there!" = "";
"If I miss this, my life will be worth less than used dental floss!" = "";
"Shhh! Don't be upset! I need to make it absolutely perfect or they won't let you in!" = "";
"Don't 'shhh!' me!" = "";
"I must warn you, though... If you google 'hopelessly overhyped', you might find a wiki on old Pinkie-L." = "";
"Oh, what do you know - with your beard and your keen sense of observation?!" = "";
"Stop right there. I need to validate your identification" = "";
"Scanning protocol initiated..." = "";
"ACCESS DENIED: No barcode found" = "";
"Only TRUE fans of Pink Lizard are allowed to proceed!" = "";
"I can assure you, I am a true fan! Truer than true! Pinky swear!" = "";
"Negative. TRUE fans are identifiable by a barcode tattoo with their social network account on their body" = "";
"A tattoo? On my body, seriously? WHY?!" = "";
"It is the only requirement for entry. Without it, I cannot let you in. Those are the rules." = "";
"Fine, I'll go get a tattoo. Jeez!" = "";
"Can you at least just give me a sneak peek of the show or something?" = "";
"Negative. I am programmed to allow entry only to fans with the proper identification." = "";
"It is not advisible to cheat. That is considered a major violation, resulting in your permanent banishment from this establishment." = "";
"Me cheat? Why, the very thought...!" = "";
"Okay, I'll need to find some way to cheat!" = "";
"Yeah, I know. I'm on it!" = "";
"I am a TRUE fan!" = "";
"Look at my brand new tattoo" = "";
"ACCESS GRANTED: You are allowed to proceed." = "";
"He doesn't seem the chatty type to me." = "";
"An empty box will get me nowhere" = "";
"TDD, get ready - it's showtime!" = "";
"If I can manage to sneak you backstage, you must find out the title of Pink Lizard's latest secret single." = "";
"Got it?" = "";
"Hi. I've got a package for a Mr. Pink Lizard here." = "";
"Negative. I am not aware of any incoming delivery." = "";
"How could you? It's a mega super duper express delivery. It's there before you even order it!" = "";
"Does not compute! Access denied!" = "";
"No problem! I'll take the package back to our delivery center so that Mr. Lizard can PERSONALLY pick it up." = "";
"I mean, if he finds the time. There may be a queue involved." = "";
"Processing...processing..." = "";
"Tell you what: You stand here and process some more while I write down your serial number...so that your boss knows you were the one that send me back." = "";
"Negative!" = "";
"Negative what?" = "";
"Exception granted. Please proceed to deliver package." = "";
"Yes! Artificial intelligence at work." = "";
"Thanks a lot!" = "";
"I'll need to dig up some dirt on Pink Lizard before I leave!" = "";
"I need a good reason to talk to that guard" = " ";
"It's starting to get moldy, I don't think it will help at all" = "";
"The amount of moldy gas it produces is so little, I don't think it can help at all" = "";
"Ouch! It's hot!" = "";
"There's no way I can hack this..." = "";
"Not sure I wanna how I'll look in ten years..." = "";
"I'm not wearing this without a very good reason" = "";
"Guess you won't be needing this anymore, right?" = "";
"No! I just want to play with Mali" = "";
"It's not really fun playing with it alone..." = "";
"Can I borrow it?" = "";
"Sure, I just need Mali to be happy" = "";
"Man, those look delicious!" = "";
"Only one way to find out. Can I have one?" = "";
"They better do, or else I've wasted 5 years at burger college!" = "";
"Sure. That'll be 5 cyber credits!" = "";
"Great!" = "";
"Except I don't have any money..." = "";
"Well, then you can't get a burger." = "";
"I'm a burger man. Not the burger welfare." = "";
"Isn't there any other way to get one?" = "";
"Seems legit." = "";
"Hey, maybe we can barter?" = "";
"Hmm, let me think..." = "";
"How about this: you do 10 push-ups and then you can have a burger." = "";
"Sorry. Haha, for a second there I thought you said push-ups!" = "";
"Then your ears work like a charm, buddy." = "";
"10 push-ups. Pronto!" = "";
"What? Why?" = "";
"Because I really wanna see you do 10 push-ups." = "";
"Don't mean to be personal but..." = "";
"...are you some kind of pervert?" = "";
"Nope. I'm just a simple burger man who loves to make his burgers" = "";
"and see no-good wimps who think they can scrounge everything in life sweating from every pore of their spindly bodies." = "";
"Oh yes. Sweet, salty, oily sweat..." = "";
"Ahhh!!" = "";
"Hey, I can do 10 push-ups!" = "";
"It's just..." = "";
"...I'm not really in the mood today, 's all." = "";
"Yeah, sure." = "";
"So." = "";
"No burger for you. Unless..." = "";
"What? I do 20 jumping jacks?" = "";
"I was gonna say, 'find some money'. But the jumping jacks will do, too." = "";
"Okay. Money it is, then." = "";
"I thought as much." = "";
"Do you have any strange hobbies?" = "";
"What? Oh no no, I'm a very honorable person, I just work here all day and all night, I don't have time for anything else" = "";
"I see... actually, you look like you have a lot of energy, do you ever do any sort of outdoor activities?" = "";
"No time for that" = "";
"Do you ever take any kind of vacations or trips?" = "";
"No, I'm too busy with work." = "";
"Sounds depressing" = "";
"It is what it is" = "";
"By the way, you look like someone who's into terrible music." = "";
"As luck would have it, I am!" = "";
"Can you help me with some questions regarding Pink Lizard, perhaps?" = "";
"Can I?! CAN I!?!" = "";
"Of course I can! I know everything about him!" = "";
"Gee, what a convenient coincidence!" = "";
"Let's see..." = "";
"Do you know when he released his very first single?" = "";
"Remember when I told you that I know everything about Pink Lizard?" = "";
"As if it was just seconds ago." = "";
"Well, as it turns out...that's the only thing I DON'T know about him." = "";
"Uh, okay. No biggie." = "";
"Let's see, the next one..." = "";
"Do you know the title of his debut album?" = "";
"Of course I... don't. Sorry. For some reason that one escapes me, too." = "";
"Okay, let's try the next one." = "";
"What's Pink Lizard's real name?" = "";
"Well, that's an easy one!" = "";
"Finally!" = "";
"It's Pink Lizard, of course!" = "";
"Or isn't it?" = "";
"Maybe, and this is only a suggestion, you should really stick to flipping burgers." = "";
"And fantasize about customers doing push-ups." = "";
"Okay, last try..." = "";
"Do you know what Pink Lizard's favorite color is?" = "";
"Um..." = "";
"Who's sweating now, huh?" = "";
"I'll..." = "";
"...have to pass." = "";
"Back to burger flipping, then." = "";
"Would you lend me that toy horse?" = "";
"Hey there, kiddo. Would you mind lending me that hobby horse thingie?" = "";
"No way! I'm playing with it!" = "";
"But I need it for this super urgent mission I'm on!" = "";
"So do I!" = "";
"I highly doubt that." = "";
"By the way: my mommy told me not to talk to strangers. Especially bearded ones who enter our home uninvited." = "";
"Under normal circumstances that would be a good point. But as I said: super urgent mission. With emphasis on the 'urgent' part." = "";
"Nope. Can't have it." = "";
"Please!" = "";
"Na-ah." = "";
"Pretty pretty please with a cherry on top!" = "";
"Okay." = "";
"Really?" = "";
"NO, you loser!" = "";
"What do you want with that old thing anyway?" = "";
"That's top secret." = "";
"Yeah, as if." = "";
"And now get lost before I call my mom!" = "";
"(Brat.)" = "";
"You still here?" = "";
"What's this cute character on your t-shirt?" = "";
"What, him? That's Mali, the lovable gopher, star of the 'Mali the lovable gopher' show!" = "";
"He's my favourite character of all time!" = "";
"Wouldn't you rather play with some Mali action figures, then, instead of this hobby horse, like you're some 19th century orphan boy or something?" = "";
"I would! But mommy doesn't want to buy me one." = "";
"It's too expensive', she says, 'for an ugly toy cheaply made in a Southeast Asian sweatshop.'" = "";
"Moms – amirite?" = "";
"Soo... if I can get you a cool Mali toy to play with – can I have your horse in exchange?" = "";
"Really, you would do that?" = "";
"That would be AWESOMESAUCE, Mister! Mali is all I need to be happy!" = "";
"What about motherly love, a nice home and healthy things to eat?" = "";
"No, $%#& that #$%&#!" = "";
"Wow. Language, young man!" = "";
"But I'm gonna get you your toy. Promise!" = "";
"Thanks, mister! Til then – GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!" = "";
"Fair enough." = "";
"Keep playing!" = "";
"Umm, why would she want that?" = "";
"I think this could work as a wireless receiver" = "";
"This is exactly what it was missing!" = "";
"Upgrading it..." = "";
"Done! Now it plays remote files!" = "";
"Looks like Crypto is making progress. He m-m-m-managed to get me backstage the Pink Lizard show." = "";
"I'm positive I can find out that secret song title." = "";
"Initiating search mode!" = "";
"A music sheet from a couple years ago" = "";
"It uses a very weird chords progression. There is no way it can sound good at all, even to human ears." = "";
"There are four lines that say..." = "";
"*C* The day is so bright *A* And my heart thumps" = "";
"*C* I will find you *F* At every new beginning" = "";
"*D* I can't live without you *A* Not another day" = "";
"*E* Spend your time with me *A* And stay together always" = "";
"I hurts me to scan this, even though I don't have any e-e-emotions." = "";
"Looks like the microphone is a-a-activated and recording." = "";
"The safe is locked, but my sensors indicate that there is an special guitar in there." = "";
"The lock is a simple 4 number wheel... I could oo-o-open it with my laser, but it's more discreet to find the combination first." = "";
"Let's try this..." = "";
"SUCCESS!" = "";
"Looks like I got something wrong" = "";
"Negative. This is not the right combination." = "";
"Initiate next try." = "";
"Maybe the next try has a higher chance of success." = "";
"I need some kind of pattern to be able to guess it" = "";
"A unique 8 string guitar!" = "";
"My sensors indicate it has really strange tuning, and the last 4 strings are not tuned at all." = "";
"I can tune the string with my hot/cold laser" = "";
"But it might be preferable to just tune the last four strings that are completely untuned" = "";
"Tuning accomplished. Playing open chord now." = "";
"That sounds like a secret single title" = "";
"Nothing h-h-happened." = "";
"That mixer is at the first position" = "";
"That mixer is at the second position" = "";
"That mixer is at the third position" = "";
"That mixer is at the fourth position" = "";
"I'm not sure it's the right tuning" = "";
"Mission complete. Retuning back to C-C-Crypto now." = "";
"Hello there. Hope I'm not interrupting anything." = "";
"Only THE GREATEST TIME OF MY LIFE." = "";
"Yeah, you look positively THRILLED." = "";
"Couldn't help but notice you got a lot of Pink Lizard Merch there." = "";
"Yeah! You're a fan, too?" = "";
"Let's say I'm lizard-curious." = "";
"Awesome! Never too late to become real PLFFL." = "";
"A what now?" = "";
"Pink Lizard Fan For Life." = "";
"Ah." = "";
"By the way, you can win one piece of merch if you answer 4 trivia questions correctly!" = "";
"Sure, why not. Shoot!" = "";
"I'd like to try the trivia game again" = "";
"Let's do it!" = "";
"Question 1: What was the name of Pink Lizard's debut album?" = "";
"The Lizard Strikes Back, of course" = "";
"The Lizard King, of course" = "";
"The Lizards Take the World, of course" = "";
"The Lizard Love, of course" = "";
"Question 2: What's his favorite color?" = "";
"Mine is black, so, let's go with black" = "";
"What about red?" = "";
"Pink – isn't it obvious?" = "";
"I'd say... yellow!" = "";
"What's Pink Lizard's real name?" = "";
"John Smith" = "";
"Ziggy Stardustle" = "";
"Dave Grohlvin" = "";
"Roberto Plantini" = "";
"Question 4: what year did Pink Lizard release his first single?" = "";
"This year" = "";
"Last year" = "";
"I'm sorry, you only answered..." = "";
"...questions correctly!" = "";
"Amazing, you got all of them right! However, to make sure you get the free merch, there's one last question." = "";
"When you think you got it all... there's always a next step" = "";
"Final question: What's the title of Pink Lizard's yet to be released and secret single?" = "";
"It's called THE DARKEST NIGHT" = "";
"It's called Pinky Melodies" = "";
"It's called The Lizard" = "";
"It's called Reptile Love" = "";
"It's called Shady Behaviour" = "";
"Oh, close, very close! But wrong." = "";
"Amazing! Sure you aren't a PLFFL already?" = "";
"Here, take this pig nose! You earned it!" = "";
"Yeah, wow. Thanks. I think, uh, I'll have a lot of fun it." = "";
"How come he sings so badly?" = "";
"Wow, that is some impressive, uh, let's call it 'singing' he's doing there." = "";
"Awesome, isn't it? Man, P-Liz always rocks the house like there's no tomorrow!" = "";
"The people can't stay in their seats!" = "";
"Maybe it's their hemorrhoids." = "";
"No way, they love it, man, just as do I!" = "";
"Maybe I'm just getting too old for this sh... sheer loud volume." = "";
"See you later, alligator!" = "";
"I'd like to try the FINAL question again" = "";
"I'd like to try the trivia game again" = "";
"You don't happen to know anything about the CyberSphere, do you?" = "";
"The cyber-what? Sounds like a prog rock band." = "";
"So the answer's no. Got it." = "";
"Does it have anything to do with Pink Lizard?" = "";
"Maybe?" = "";
"I need to know everything about him!" = "";
"Actually... it has nothing to do with him?" = "";
"Then I'm not really interested." = "";
"Don't you know somebody here in the CyberSphere with..." = "";
"Say... have you met anyone here in the CyberSphere who's behaving a bit, let's say, shady?" = "";
"Shady?" = "";
"As in: suspicious. Untrustworthy. Not what you would call an upright citizen. If you catch my drift." = "";
"Sorry, I don't know anyone like that. And I must confess, I'm not entirely sure what a CyberSphere is, either. Why do you ask?" = "";
"Oh, let's say, I need someone to help me with a little side project that requires a certain level of...moral flexibility." = "";
"Huh. I see. I'm afraid I don't associate with those kinds of people. My friends fall more in the 'upright citizen' category." = "";
"I'm sure they do. Well, thanks anyway." = "";
"No problem. Good luck with your little, um, project." = "";
"Sorry, can you tell me what's up with that barcode tattoo?" = "";
"I'd be happy to!" = "";
"See, it's the only way to gain access to Pink Lizard's rock show." = "";
"It's a highly exclusive event and only those with the tattoo are allowed in." = "";
"Yeah, but – getting a tattoo just for a rock show? Isn't that a bit... extreme?" = "";
"My friend, let me tell you: I would take much more extreme measures to see Pink Lizard perform live and on stage!" = "";
"Such as?" = "";
"I would gladly give him a body part or two if he asked for it." = "";
"Wow. That's what I call devotion." = "";
"Of course I wouldn't be too sad if it was just a finger. Or a toe." = "";
"I can imagine." = "";
"So a little ink on my skin isn't even worth mentioning." = "";
"(Or the excruciating pain that comes with it...)" = "";
"Plus: once I'm in, I'll be able to rub shoulders with other fans and celebrities." = "";
"So you see, it's really a small price to pay for all the bragging rights and social status I'll gain!" = "";
"I'm so excited for you. Fingers crossed for that body part thing!" = "";
"What can you tell me about Pink Lizard?" = "";
"Only that he is one of the most gifted, brillant, charming, and yet down-to-earth human being that ever existed in the history of the universe." = "";
"Plus: He's incredibly rich and has a lot of influence." = "";
"And here I was thinking that he was just a lousy, wannabe rock star." = "";
"Wannabe?!? Are you deaf?" = "";
"He's like... if Mozart and Mick Jagger had a love child, it would be him." = "";
"The way he seems to just glide through the air. His awesome taste in clothes. His perfect hair, the color of a cloud at sunset..." = "";
"Yeah. A real dreamboat." = "";
"Also: he lives in a freakin' CASTLE!! How cool is that?" = "";
"God, why can't I be like him?" = "";
"WHY??!" = "";
"Sounds all a bit too good to be true, if you ask me. Maybe a bit... shady, you might say." = "";
"Don't be silly! Pink Lizard's the perfect human being. A god among mortals. You and me are just DIRT under his feet." = "";
"Uh-huh." = "";
"He also seems mighty good at brainwashing. Hmm... I'll need to investigate further!" = "";
"Say, do you know the title of Pink Lizard's secret single?" = "";
"WHAT? A new secret single!? Why didn't anyone tell me??" = "";
"Guess that's a 'no', then." = "";
"Hasta luego!" = "";
"Nice glasses, by the way." = "";
"Yeah! They're a replica of Pink Lizard's trademark glasses." = "";
"I don't even need them, but I look cooler this way, don't you think?" = "";
"Super duper cool." = "";
"Can I borrow them for a sec?" = "";
"Are you crazy? No way!" = "";
"Yeah, I thought so." = "";
"I see..." = "";
"Do you know the title of Pinks Lizard's debut album?" = "";
"Hi there. Might seem a bit random, but you don't happen to know the title of Pink Lizard's debut album, do you?" = "";
"Are you kidding? Of course I do!" = "";
"It's The Lizards Take the world, of course." = "";
"Of course, yeah! Just a little test." = "";
"Do you know when Pink lizard released his first single?" = "";
"So... do you know when Pink lizard released his first single, too?" = "";
"Oh, I've got a dreadful memory for dates, I'm afraid." = "";
"I don't really care about that" = "";
"As long as he continues to consistently upload great content, I am content with the situation" = "";
"As long as he continues to consistently upload awesome content, I'm happy, you know?" = "";
"Well, good for you!" = "";
"It looks like a tattoo of a lizard tail." = "";
"This one was tricky. Sadly, the customer wasn't quite satisfied with the end result." = "";
"I still remember his name... Roberto Plantini" = "";
"Awesome name!" = "";
"I'd better make sure I have the right color first" = "";
"This will come in very handy" = "";
"Meanwhile" = "";
"Somewhere else" = "";
"Muhuahaha!" = "";
"For far too long, the world laughed at me. But now it's my turn!" = "";
"My injuries might have left my body weak and helpless. But I'm not just some teenager sitting in his mom's basement, trying to hack into goverment websites – at least not anymore!" = "";
"No – I, the mighty Blackchain, have finally found a way to get revenge for all those cruel taunts I had to endure these past years." = "";
"For I have discovered the power of THE CYBERSPHERE - a realm of infinite possibilities, where I can control the minds of others!" = "";
"Now, finally, The inner workings of the Sphere are at my command. Its codes and algorithms are like putty in my hand!" = "";
"I can manipulate its very fabric, bending it to my will and using it as a weapon against my enemies!" = "";
"With this power, I will finally make those who have wronged me PAY!" = "";
"I will rule the CyberSphere with an iron fist, bending the minds of all who stand in my way and making them my adoring SLAVES!" = "";
"And those who dare to challenge me will be CRUSHED beneath my feet!" = "";
"Soon, very soon, I will be the SUPREME LEADER OF THE CYBERSPHERE!" = "";
"Muhuhahaha!" = "";
"But first..." = "";
"...there's always time for a nice cup of coffee!" = "";
"Yummy!" = "";
"So... the Sphere informs me there is a new guy in town." = "";
"Calling himself a hacker." = "";
"Ha!" = "";
"I've dealt with hackers before, and he'll wind up just like all the others" = "";
"I've already implemented numerous security protocols and counter-measures to protect myself against any attack." = "";
"Also: I have a vast network of nodes at my disposal." = "";
"This so called hacker might think he's clever. But he'll soon find out that he's no match for my superior intelligence and myriad abilities!" = "";
"He won't know what hit him! His mind will be wax in my hands!" = "";
"Ts. 'Hacker.'" = "";
"HACK is more like it!" = "";
"(Aw man, that was a good one, I need to write that down!)" = "";
"So, my new arch nemesis has a name." = "";
"CRYPTO!" = "";
"Looks like he's cleverer than his predecessors. He's already making more progress than he should..." = "";
"Hmm..." = "";
"I may need to be cautious in order to avoid detection. I can't risk to expose my plans at this stage of the game." = "";
"I need to use more advanced techniques and tools to obscure my movements and mask my identity." = "";
"But that's just a temporary nuisance." = "";
"So, 'Crypto'..." = "";
"Enjoy your free will as long as you have it." = "";
"Soon you'll see that the mighty Blackchain will crush his enemies like the flies they are – sooner or later!" = "";
"I will use all of my vast resources and intelligence to find your weaknesses." = "";
"And then..." = "";
"IT'S FLY-CRUSHING TIME!!" = "";
"PINK LIZARD!!!" = "";
"Once again you disappoint me!" = "";
"You do NOTHING but use the knowledge I gave you for your own gain!" = "";
"I will deal with you later, useless lackey." = "";
"But first, it's time for me to take action myself." = "";
"Crypto..." = "";
"...it seems I underestimated you BIG TIME!" = "";
"But the time for games is over!" = "";
"Soon, you will face me on the battlefield." = "";
"Eye to eye." = "";
"Man to man." = "";
"And then we will see who is the greatest hacker of all time!" = "";
"Muhahahaha!" = "";
"Spoiler alert..." = "";
"IT WILL BE ME!!!" = "";
"Muhahahahahaahahaha!" = "";
"Wow, is that a SPACESHIP?" = "";
"Heck, yeah. Say hello to the Starcruiser LAH 0009!" = "";
"Wow, cool! What you gonna do it with it?" = "";
"Star cruisin'" = "";
"Yeah, makes sense." = "";
"At least I would be, but the damn thing's giving me trouble. Perhaps you could help me out?" = "";
"Depends on your problem, I guess. What's wrong?" = "";
"I can't access the CyberSphere to get a full scan of the onboard computer." = "";
"Um, that's because you're already INSIDE the Sphere." = "";
"What do you mean? Hello – I'm here, in my ship's garage, right in front of you!" = "";
"Yeah, this simulation is really convincing, I know, but..." = "";
"Simulation? What are you talking about?" = "";
"The simulated universe inside the CyberSphere. It's so immersive, you might think it's all real." = "";
"Hate to break it to you, but your body's still in the real world, floating inside some kind of fish tank thingie, while your consciousness has been transferred into the CyberSphere." = "";
"Are you high on something right now – or just crazy?" = "";
"I know, it's hard to believe. I'm still a little shocked myself." = "";
"So... all of this is a simulation, huh?" = "";
"Yep." = "";
"And I'm reaIly somewhere out there, in a tank." = "";
"Exacta-mundo!" = "";
"Why would I put myself in some tank, huh?" = "";
"Dunno. Maybe you're some kind of beta tester. Or maybe you're a hacker, like myself, trying to get into the EHP." = "";
"The what?" = "";
"Doesn't matter. It's complicated." = "";
"You know what? On seconds thought, I think I don't really need your help. But you should look for a good therapist or something, buddy. Bye!" = "";
"Welcome back, nutcase." = "";
"Hey Billie." = "";
"Hi again, Mr Crypto." = "";
"Just Crypto, please, 'Mr Crypto' was my dad." = "";
"What can you tell me about this Pink Lizard?" = "";
"Say, Billie, what can you tell me about this Pink Lizard character?" = "";
"Gee, I don't know much about him, I'm afraid. But rumor has it he's some kind of shadow ruler of this town." = "";
"Shadow ruler? Pray tell!" = "";
"And do the rumors say what exactly makes him so powerful?" = "";
"That's the thing, nobody knows! It happened overnight, so to speak. One day, he was a nobody like you and me, and then – BAM! – suddenly, he's the king of the world." = "";
"Yeah. Doesn't sound fishy AT ALL." = "";
"You think so?" = "";
"No, I was being sarcastic." = "";
"Oooooh!" = "";
"Gee, now that you mention it... it really sounds suspicious. Strange, I never really thought about that." = "";
"Mighty strange, indeed." = "";
"I'll investigate further on that matter." = "";
"Good luck to you, then! Bye-bye!" = "";
"This CyberSphere is beyond incredible!" = "";
"Holy Turing, this CyberSphere is beyond incredible! All those details. I can even see your nose hairs!" = "";
"Teehee, wanted to cut them since forever." = "";
"But say... what is this CyberSphere you're talking about?" = "";
"C'mon, you know none of this is real, right?" = "";
"None of what?" = "";
"This room, this chair, this needle – everything." = "";
"Ohhhh! I see!" = "";
"Are you sure?" = "";
"Couldn't be any surer." = "";
"You mean, we're in some kind of computer world, like the Matrix?" = "";
"Bull's-eye!" = "";
"Teehee." = "";
"Oh, Mr Crypto, you almost had me there. 'None of this is real'. Now that's a good one!" = "";
"I'm not joking, man." = "";
"Teehee, your pokerface makes it even funnier!" = "";
"*Sigh* Yeah, that's me. Crypto Funny Guy." = "";
"Oh! Didn't know that was your last name!" = "";
"Not gonna lie..." = "";
"...this is a bit frustrating." = "";
"I'm okay with just one!" = "";
"Hey there, young man! Is there something I can help you with?" = "";
"Uh, no, I'm just admiring this painting." = "";
"Oh, it's a beautiful piece, isn't it? 'William Burroughs in the Sky with Diamonds.' One of my favorites. And I'm not just saying that because I painted it." = "";
"Yeah, it's really nice. I was just wondering what color the artist used for the sky." = "";
"Oh, that's a special color. It's called 'Rose Petal Pink.' I mixed it myself to capture the beauty of the sunset" = "";
"Oh, I see. I was thinking of using that color for my own artwork, y'know?" = "";
"Oh, I'll gladly share the mixture with you. Always happy to help fellow artists." = "";
"Really? That would be great!" = "";
"This unique color is created by mixing a scarlet red along with the brightest color of all" = "";
"And finally, adding a touch of evening sky blue" = "";
"Unfortunatley, I've run out of it... So you'll have to mix it yourself, dearie." = "";
"No problem, I'm really good at making stuff." = "";
"Just remember to give credit to the me and my unique color. It's important for artists to support each other, wouldn't you say?" = "";
"It really is. I'd never think about stealing someone else's work, Ma'am!" = "";
"There's that familiar and unique color." = "";
"The nice old lady told me that it's created by mixing a scarlet red with the brightest color of all..." = "";
"And finally, adding a touch of evening sky blue" = "";
"My dear, I'm afraid I can't let you leave with the color, I'm really low on supplies, you know." = "";
"Sorry, ma'am. Didn't mean no harm." = "";
"The evening sky blue color" = "";
"A common blue color" = "";
"Do you know you're inside a virtual reality?" = "";
"One question, ma'am." = "";
"Yes, what is it, dearie?" = "";
"You know you're inside the virtual reality of CyberSphere, don't you?" = "";
"Now, what's a CyberSphere, dearie?" = "";
"You too, huh?" = "";
"It's another world, that feels totally real, which you can only enter through your mind." = "";
"Ah! NOW I know what you mean!" = "";
"Of course I know that world. I'm not a stranger to it myself. I don't call it the CyberSphere, though, but 'Timothy Leary Space' instead. Been there quite often, with my good old friend Alice Dee." = "";
"Okay, I'm REALLY starting to think something's off here!" = "";
"How so?" = "";
"Ma'am, I don't know how to break it too you, but you are inside the CyberSphere – a virtual cosmos. All that you see, feel, hear, taste and smell is just a simulation, a computer program." = "";
"Oh, my dear boy..." = "";
"...seems like you've spent a little too much time with Alice..." = "";
"*Sigh*. Nevermind." = "";
"What kind of fish is that in your tank?" = "";
"Hmm? Oh, that's a cleaner wrasse. It eats all kinds of dirt and algae inside the tank." = "";
"Sounds quite useful." = "";
"Indeed. I call him Mr Clean." = "";
"He's so good at his job that he even cleans the tank of other fish." = "";
"Aren't you sure you didn't buy a piranha?" = "";
"Absolutely. He's a very gentle soul, Mr Clean is. Sometimes he'll try to clean my hand when I put it in the tank." = "";
"Let's hope he doesn't bite the hand that feeds him." = "";
"Well, hello there, dearie. Welcome to my art studio. Why don't you stay and take a look at my art gallery?" = "";
"Maybe you'll find a piece you'd like to buy. I can make you a nice cup of tea if you like." = "";
"Or maybe you'd like something even MORE relaxing? You know... something purely herbal." = "";
"*Wink, wink*" = "";
"Color me tempted, ma'am, but for now I'm just exploring the town." = "";
"Whatever you like, dearie. No need to feel rushed." = "";
"Did you paint all those pictures?" = "";
"I think so." = "";
"My memory's a little flakey, you see. They're all from what I call my 'green phase.'" = "";
"I see." = "";
"This one's called 'Amsterdam vibes'. And this one 'The devil's lettuce'. And this one I call 'A nice afternoon with Mary Jane.'" = "";
"Beginning to sense a pattern here." = "";
"Speaking of patterns: Have you met anyone in the last few days whose behavior was what you might call a little suspicious?" = "";
"Sorry, dearie. I don't notice much of what's going on in this town when I'm in..." = "";
"...your green phase?" = "";
"Exactly." = "";
"I see. Well, that's it for now, ma'am, thank you. Maybe I'll get back to your offer later. You know – to have something strictly herbal." = "";
"*Wink, wink*" = "";
"Anytime, my dear. Good luck with your search. Be careful out there!" = "";
"Yes, ma'am!" = "";
"This fish needs to be fed a daily dose of trash to maintain its health and cleaning abilities." = "";
"It's important to provide a variety of different types of waste for the fish to consume..." = "";
"... such as algae, leftover food, and other organic matter" = "";
"This will ensure that the cleaning wrasse has a balanced diet and can continue to effectively clean the tank" = "";
"Pink lizard rock show!" = "";
"Witness his electrifying stage presence and catchy tunes. Be there or be square!" = "";
"Um, drinking the ink might be not as healthy as it sounds!" = "";
"I believe I've found the target! Can you check on this Pink Lizard?" = "";
"I was thinking the same, I've already scanned his records and they were modified recently" = "";
"Some information is m-m-missing." = "";
"Let's take a little trip to that castle of his and see what I can find out there." = "";
"Affirmative. This might progress your training." = "";
"Man, no one here seems to know that they're inside the CyberSphere. It's damn eerie, to say the least!" = "";
"Affirmative. It's very strange i-i-indeed. You should investigate the matter." = "";
"It already has red" = "";
"It already has white" = "";
"It already has blue" = "";
"I think I should draw something on the paper first..." = "";
"I should get all the information about that Pink Lizard guy from Nestor first..." = "";
"Man, when it rains, it pours. Even in virtual reality." = "";
"I've got all the pieces of the costume! Let's make it!" = "";
"Time to sneak into Pink Lizard's castle and find something that'll expose him to the world!" = "";
"I mean, the CyberSphere" = "";
"I've arrived" = "";
"I'm not going anywhere until I find something that will expose Pink Lizard to the CyberSphere!" = "";
"An illuminated, incredible painting" = "";
"Well, would you look at that! The artist's signature was written with invisible ink!" = "";
"What a name... maybe it's an instagram account?" = "";
"Interesting..." = "";
"Enter password" = "";
"Wrong Password" = "";
"pink lizard" = "";
"pink lizard is the best" = "";
"I'll never guess it" = "";

"There's a folder here called... MemoryWipe" = "";
"Suspicious..." = "";
"Oh my Bezos!" = "";
"TDD! Can you copy all of this to your files?" = "";
"Affirmative. You are making excellent progress" = "";
"Pink Lizard has been joining forces with somebody called BLACKCHAIN to gain control of the whole CyberSphere" = "";
"So THAT is why nobody knows about the CyberSphere!" = "";
"They were hacked by this BlackChain guy! It's like a virus but in the virtual reality. THAT is why they don't know they're in the CyberSphere!" = "";
"Once he controls everyone, he will be the absolute ruler of the Sphere!" = "";
"The s-s-supreme Hacker will be very proud of you. I'm sure he doesn't know about this malfunction of the system" = "";
"That's why nobody completed the Elite Hackers Program - they're all trapped here!" = "";
"I'm gonna tell everyone about this! They have to know what's been done to them!" = "";
"Good luck!" = "";
"*ring* *ring*" = "";
"Whoa! Ada freakin' Lovelace! A call – here? In the CyberSphere?!" = "";
"Who's there?" = "";
"Crypto, listen carefully, you are in GRAVE DANGER!" = "";
"Who are you? How do you know my phone number?" = "";
"BlackChain knows about you, and he is coming here to exterminate you." = "";
"I am your only chance of survival!" = "";
"Yeah, nice try, pal. As Sesame Street taught me: never trust a stranger." = "";
"I'm gonna need some more info first!" = "";
"You don't know me, but I KNOW you: Crypto, the wannabe elite hacker." = "";
"Amazing, it's like you looked directly into my soul!" = "";
"I'm afraid you'll have to put some more effort into this, buddy." = "";
"Listen, there's NO TIME!" = "";
"I'm going to open a portal – jump through it and you'll live. Stay here and you'll die. It's your choice." = "";
"But choose quickly!" = "";
"*Click*" = "";
"I can't believe it!" = "";
"He hung up without even saying goodbye!" = "";
"Boy, of all the weird things happening today..." = "";
"...this one ranked somerwhere in the middle." = "";
"But he sounded serious, I'll give him that." = "";
"My gut tells me to trust him. If Blackchain actually controls the CyberSphere, there's so many messed up things he could do to me..." = "";
"But... what if the call is a trap from him? I've never used a portal before..." = "";
"Who knows what's on the other side?" = "";
"Okay, here I go! Let's hope I'll make it to the other side alive!" = "";
"My gut feeling tells me that I should enter the portal..." = "";
"I found the information! I should go and tell everyone!" = "";
"There's nothing hidden here..." = "";
"There's no time to rock now!" = "";
"Woo-hoo! I'm finally IN!" = "";
"You are d-d-doing great." = "";
"You mastered two of the three skills required of you." = "";
"Camouflage, by making a costume to get past the security c-c-camera" = "";
"Trespassing, by entering this castle" = "";
"There's only one l-l-left: thievery..." = "";
"Don't worry, my floating friend!" = "";
"I'm pretty sure Pinkie has some incriminating stuff on his computer." = "";
"I'm gonna steal it and expose him as the megalomaniacal brainwasher that he is." = "";
"So all of the CyberSphere will know he's been messing with their minds." = "";
"Here we go!" = "";
"About the CyberSphere..." = "";
"Do you need help fixing the spaceship?" = "";
"I see your spaceship has a last generation sound system. Cool!" = "";
"What do you know about this Pink Lizard guy?" = "";
"Do you know the title of Pink Lizard's secret single?" = "";
"I'm all out of questions" = "";
"Actually...I do" = "";
"Have you tried banging it with a hammer yet?" = "";
"The problem is that I need to check if the engine is working properly, but I'm out of fuel." = "";
"Ah, I see. What kind of fuel does this thing run on? Plutonium? Love?" = "";
"Actually it runs on fermantation gas. Totally eco-friendly." = "";
"Cool!" = "";
"I'll let you know if I find any" = "";
"Yeah, it's absolutely state of the art!" = "";
"The sound quality will blow your mind - um, as soon as I get this baby running again, that is." = "";
"So, it can handle the epic guitar solo in 'Stairway to Heaven'?" = "";
"Abso-freaking-lutely. This sound system is capable of handling ANYTHING you throw at it." = "";
"Man, I'll definitely have to test that, then. Maybe we can have a little rock concert in the spaceship" = "";
"Sounds like a great idea." = "";
"You really are in a virtual world!" = "";
"C'mon, don't you think I'd know if that was the case?" = "";
"You don't remember taking a pill, everything fading to white...?" = "";
"I totally don't." = "";
"He's the most popular guy around here." = "";
"He even lives in a Castle, like a king or something!" = "";
"A castle? Neat." = "";
"Everyone loves him, he's a really special person, you know?" = "";
"Even tough he's the new kid on the block." = "";
"Do you know the title of his debut album, by any chance?" = "";
"Nah, can't say I do. I'm focusing on more important things. Like GETTING THIS FREAKIN' SHIP TO WORK!" = "";
"And his real name?" = "";
"Pink Lizard?" = "";
"Okay. Unfortunately, that's not very helpful." = "";
"A secret single? No idea." = "";
"Okay..." = "";
"Hey TDD! Can you login to Pink Lizard's computer?" = "";
"A-A-Affirmative. But you should find your own way to complete the training." = "";
"Yeah.. of course" = "";
"Greetings Crypto. Are you m-m-making progress?" = "";
"Nice color" = "";
"Brilliant" = "";
"Mixing colors, just like when I was a little kid." = "";
"What an awesome color!" = "";
"The box says: 'Magical Beans'. I wonder what kind of magic will they do: black? white? Checkered?" = "";
"Looks like this security cam works with a partially advanced facial recognition system, I'm sure I can hack it easy-peasy, I'll just need a costume..." = "";
"An awesome-looking, but partially dismantled, spaceship" = "";
"A tattoo shop!" = "";
"Who's there?" = "";
"It's your conscience, open up and let me in" = "";
"The person you've been trying to avoid." = "";
"The ghost of Christmas past." = "";
"Your long lost twin" = "";
"The Tooth Fairy! I'm coming for your molars!" = "";
"Your imaginary childhood friend." = "";
"Hi, I'm Felix Raudster. I'm here to sell you a timeshare!" = "";
"The bogeyman" = "";
"I'm you, but FROM THE FUTURE!" = "";
"The IRS!" = "";
"Shut up and leave me alone!" = "";
"Heehee, I love intercom pranks!" = "";
"This must be where Pink Lizard lives" = "";
"Nice castle. If I were a godlike musician, I'd want one myself." = "";
"My nice little robot friend." = "";
"A sticker with a barcode. There's nothing special about it." = "";
"Finally! I bet I can trick Pink Lizard's security cam with this!" = "";
"A real brickhouse of a guy." = "";
"Man, he looks eerily familiar ... where have I seen him before?" = "";
"A common mini fridge." = "";
"A digital photo of the tattoo Billie is tattooing Nestor with." = "";
"Pure black ink. The bottle's half empty." = "";
"Wow! This skull is amazing - looks like there are some weird creatures here in the CyberSpere!" = "";
"Another book of tattoo designs. I'm not really getting anything tattooed on me, so I don't need to waste my time with it." = "";
"Oh yeah! This is Guybrush the mighty pirate! I loved all his adventures when I was little - especially 'The Curse Of Monkey Island'!" = "";
"Looks like Billie's father" = "";
"Boy, this guy looks really scary. He would make a great villain in a point-and-click adventure game!" = "";
"A nice tattoo design. Even if it is a bit to much for my taste." = "";
"A double C tattoo design, It could be my logo: Clever Crypto, or something like that" = "";
"Hey, this is the hackers emblem! Designed by Eric S. Raymond in 2003 to unify hackers culture. Awesome!" = "";
"This one's so small that I can't make anything out..." = "";
"Well, this hanger's just hanging around doing nothing." = "";
"A heart and wings tattoo. *cough* cliché! *cough*" = "";
"Hey! This mirror's not working! I guess the developer got lazy and didn't bother to add the reflection effect!" = "";
"Aww, so cute!" = "";
"It's wet. Looks like the ink can be detached from it." = "";
"The tracing paper has the barcode to enter the show inked on it!" = "";
"It's semi-transparent, used for tracing maps, drawings or designs." = "";
"I am a true fan! I got the barcode right here!" = "";
"This is not a tattoo" = "";
"No need for that, I can enter already." = "";
"Pretty hot. But also pretty... pretty." = "";
"Looks like Juliette's busy trying to fix something there." = "";
"These controls look retro and futuristic at the same time. There's no way I can make sense of them." = "";
"She's so busy..." = "";
"I guess those buttons open and close the garage door." = "";
"I guess that engine's responsible for opening and closing the garage door." = "";
"They're off. I believe they turn on when the door opens and closes." = "";
"I can already go throught the garage door, so I'll leave it as it is." = "";
"They look extremely useful" = "";
"Sorry, but I need all of 'em!" = "";
"Ropes are always super useful in adventure games, I wonder if I can pick it up?" = "";
"It's out of my reach..." = "";
"Man, this spaceship looks really amazing, I'd love to see it in action!" = "";
"It must be super powerful - if not super DUPER powerful!" = "";
"I'm pretty sure this will come in quite handy." = "";
"Nope, I need this" = "";
"He seems like a really nice kid. Like Damien." = "";
"A black light gun" = "";
"A light gun that Bruce won't use anymore" = "";
"This will make a fine addition to my Pink Lizard costume!" = "";
"A punk wig. It will look great on my Pink Lizard costume, but... something's missing." = "";
"I don't want to carry around that large stick. It looks completely useless." = "";
"A poster of that Mali character. Bruce has all kinds of merch with that rodent on. Guess it's true love." = "";
"I remember having some of those when I was a baby" = "";
"A dirty sock. Man, why do kids never clean their rooms?" = "";
"I think I'll let the sock fairies take care of this one." = "";
"A stick figure drawing of Mali. Kinda cute." = "";
"I'm sure he needs them" = "";
"Looks like you've got a long road ahead of you. Better get moving!" = "";
"At least I'll have a lot of stickers to put on my car when I'm finished here. (Not really, they're all digital simulations)" = "";
"I guess the CyberSphere has its own type of socket, too..." = "";
"Hey! It's exactly the same color as Pink Lizard's hair!" = "";
"I'm not sure if I'm supposed to paint with that, or drink it" = "";
"One of the most-printed Mali collectible cards. Worth little more than an empty candy wrapper." = "";
"I think I saw something like this in a sci-fi movie once. I'm just waiting for the tentacles to start moving." = "";
"Greetings, Crypto. Are you making any p-p-progress?" = "";
"Can you help me find some shady characters?" = "";
"It stands to reason this Pink Lizard person hides something." = "";
"How can I master the art of trespassing?" = "";
"How can I master the art of camouflage?" = "";
"How can I master the art of thievery?" = "";
"I can't get into Pink Lizard's computer" = "";
"This should be the easiest of the tasks. Just t-t-talk to the people around you." = "";
"That sounds like something I can do" = "";
"He looks like the perfect target for you to complete your training." = "";
"Great! I just need to find out what exactly he's hiding - so - where do I start?" = "";
"I'm sure you can find something in his Castle. Just sneak into it and see what you can find" = "";
"I'm on it!" = "";
"You should first focus on finding the target" = "";
"If you can sneak into Pink Lizard's Castle, we can mark it as completed" = "";
"Sounds doable to me!" = "";
"Since the security installations at Pink Lizard's castle have a facial recognition system, you c-c-could try to mimic Pink Lizard's face" = "";
"So maybe you should try to enter the Rock Show to s-s-see how he looks?" = "";
"You can make a Pink Lizard costume with just three simple elements..." = "";
"Yeah! Makes sense!" = "";
"Affirmative." = "";
"I'm sure you can find something at Pink Lizard's castle" = "";
"Okay! I'll focus on getting there, then." = "";
"Could you give me a teeny-tiny hint?" = "";
"Affirmative. Here's a hint: don't ask me for h-h-hints." = "";
"Ha ha, very funny. Could you please give me a real hint?" = "";
"Try thinking for yourself." = "";
"I'm sorry, but I can't help you, you need to figure it out yourself" = "";
"Even just a little bit?" = "";
"That would be cheating.T-t-try to use your brain and you'll figure it out." = "";
"Oh sure, I almost forgot I got a brilliant brain!" = "";
"This must be the title of the secret single!" = "";
"I can't pick anything up" = "";
"The k-k-keys to Pink Lizard's castle. They would make Crypto's quest all too easy." = "";
"The box Crypto used to deliver me. I still can't compute that he actually made it work." = "";
"So Pink Lizard uses a wig, too. That would be perfect for the c-c-c-ostume Crypto needs to make in order to sneak by the castle's security cam." = "";
"They are like the ones that Crypto is trying to get by answering the trivia questions." = "";
"Looks like the ball is ready to b-b-break some records!" = "";
"I'm sure the neighbors will be thrilled to hear Pink Lizard practicing his guitar with this." = "";
"At least he has good taste in movies." = "";
"I wish I was built with a pair of h-h-hands." = "";
"Pink Lizard doesn't deserve a Les Paul guitar at all" = "";
"Exactly the glasses Crypto needs to make his Pink Lizard costume." = "";
"Those chairs are overrated..." = "";
"I can scan Pink Lizard's show from here. Fortunately, the noise is muffled." = "";
"An empty delivery box" = "";
"TDD is hidden inside the box." = "";
"Pink Lizard's glasses. I will use them to get past the castle's security cam, along with the other costume pieces." = "";
"He looks dead serious. Gulp!" = "";
"Who needs a restaurant when you've got a mobile burger stall?" = "";
"A veggie burger... who the hell invented those?" = "";
"Nahh... it's a veggie one" = "";
"This ketchup is ready to spice up your life!" = "";
"Who needs real meat when you have garlic sauce?" = "";
"Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man" = "";
"Pizza delivery for a Mr Mike Rotch!" = "";
"It's your worst nightmare, here to haunt you with more annoying questions!" = "";
"Nobody" = "";
"The phone company! We want to remind you that you're still paying for a landline!" = "";
"I can't see anything through it" = "";
"This skull adds a macabre touch to the door." = "";
"This is an exhaust air opening, blowing boiling hot steam. Man, I hope it's not toxic or something!" = "";
"There are a few burgers to choose from" = "";
"Cheeseburger, Grilled chicken club, Bacon cheeseburger, Breakfast burger, The L.A. Way, Impossible Burger, Veggie Burger, Gourmete Burger, California Burger, Beyond Burger, House Burger..." = "";
"... and last but not least, our world-famous PIZZA BURGER" = "";
"Looks like he doesn't want it, maybe it's not dirty enough." = "";
"Man, I really have to be careful not to play this too loud. Don't wanna hurt anyone!" = "";
"This won't make the veggie burger edible" = "";
"Ketchup is like the black sheep of the condiment family – sometimes, it doesn't quite fit in." = "";
"I'm trying to give the garlic sauce a break – I think it's time to explore some other flavors." = "";
"Somehow, I suspect a VEGGIE pizza burger won't help me complete any of my current missions" = "";
"I could patent the pizza burger, I'm sure NOBODY has thought of that before!" = "";
"But I'm not sure a veggie burger and a moldy pizza will win any prizes." = "";
"This is NOT Pink Lizard's color" = "";
"A mysterious portal created by a mysterious man who claims that he wants to help me - mysteriously!" = "";
"Looks ready" = "";
"It seemed like a good idea, but... it's really not." = "";
"Black is so dark that it will be difficult to create any nice colors with it." = "";
"What do you think of this color?" = "";
"Ohh, you finally created the color! Congratulations, dearie!" = "";
"It's a nice color, but it's nothing out of the ordinary." = "";
"I don't think Ms. Mandy would approve of it" = "";
"I'd love to drive this floating motorbike, but my driving license only applies to non-floating motorbikes" = "";
"Doesn't look like it's working..." = "";
"Woo-hoo! It worked!!" = "";
"Nothing..." = "";
"Hey! Do you need this?" = "";
"I already compute with more sophisticated wireless components." = "";
"Of course..." = "";
"I just picked it up from there, I'm not putting it back again!" = "";
"Stop right there, no one is allowed to enter" = "";
